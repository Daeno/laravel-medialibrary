This medialibrary package was initially made by Freek Van der Herten. There are [many other contributors
as well](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-medialibrary/graphs/contributors).

Spatie is a webdesign agency based in Antwerp, Belgium.

Open source software is used in all projects we deliver. Laravel, Nginx, Ubuntu are just a few 
of the free pieces of software we use every single day. For this, we are very grateful. 
When we feel we have solved a problem in a way that can help other developers, 
we release our code as open source software [on GitHub](https://spatie.be/opensource).
