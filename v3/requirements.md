To create derived images [GD](http://php.net/manual/en/book.image.php) needs to be installed on your server. For the creation of pdf thumbnails [Imagick](http://php.net/manual/en/imagick.setresolution.php) is also required.

On Ubuntu you can install Imagick by issuing this command:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install imagemagick php5-imagick
```
